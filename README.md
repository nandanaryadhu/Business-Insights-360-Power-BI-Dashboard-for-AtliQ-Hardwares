# Business-Insights-360-Power-BI-Dashboard-for-AtliQ-Hardwares
A comprehensive Power BI dashboard providing a 360Â° view of business performance. Integrated data from Excel, CSV, and MySQL, applied ETL, and built dynamic models. Focused on usability, optimization, and delivering actionable insights for decision-makers.


Business Insights 360 is a Power BI project built to provide a complete view of business performance. I integrated data from Excel/CSV and MySQL, performed ETL with Power Query for cleaning and modeling, and designed both Star and Snowflake schemas for smooth analysis. Usability was enhanced with toggle buttons and bookmarks to avoid duplicate visuals, advanced tooltips with line charts for deeper KPI insights, and dynamic slicers to compare Last Year vs Target, uncovering YoY improvements while highlighting missed goals. An executive dashboard summarized key KPIs such as Zone-wise Gross Margin %, Net Profit %, and Revenue Contribution, while a ribbon chart ranked manufacturers by fiscal year. To optimize performance, I disabled unnecessary table loads, reduced column precision, and balanced DAX with Power Query transformations, achieving about 25% storage savings and ensuring efficient, insight-driven reporting.
